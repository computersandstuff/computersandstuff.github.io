It has been a while.Two years since my last upload of an Apple Airport AP.To anyone who has been following, I’ve been pretty busy and I’m trying to find time for the channel.However, recently I ran into a roadblock.About a couple months ago I released a Roblox game that allows you to print asset images on a real life receipt thermal printer at a low price. The prints could be viewed live on a YouTube livestream which I posted on my gaming/secondary channel. Keep in mind that this channel is under the same Google account as the Computers And Stuff channel. I would post these streams, often times daily and with great length. Most of the stream would just be looking at an inactive Epson printer.One day I receive an email from YouTube notifing me that my channel has been deleted for multiple/severe violation(s) of the spam/scam category. I tried appealing multiple times explaining how I did not break TOS and was not misleading in any form, but those tries only got automatic responses.YouTube’s terrible form of contact never gets a real response and for the small guys, no one will ever come to save you. So what happens? Well my gaming channel is wiped from the internet and Computers And Stuff is abandoned. As the accounts are linked I cannot upload or modify anything on the Computers And Stuff channel. It remains up, however, as the livestreams were not posted on that channel.So where do I go from here?Screw YouTube, but I’m gonna start a new channel. I’ll use this as an push to reorganize and recreate. I’ll start a new channel (hopefully) with new content and go from there.I wanted to write this to update my blog as my last post was from 2022 as well as get a bit of anger out at YT, but I hope I’ll be back soon." }, { "title": "NEC P120 Teardown - What makes up a 90s cell phone?", "url": "/posts/NEC-P120-teardown/", "categories": "teardown", "tags": "device-specs, retro-tech, phones", "date": "2022-08-17 21:36:31 +0000", "snippet": "Phones have come a long way from being bricks with minimal functionality to devices in which the “phone” function is not the most used.

They use analog signals, so tricking them into thinking that you’re an official cell tower is relatively easy provided you have the right equipment.I have found numerous articles on hacking together a 1g service. I don’t currently have an SDR, but I will get an RTL-SDR soon, but I’ll need a device with transmission capability such as LimeSDR which is unfortunately seems unavailable at the time of writing. There is also a scanner mode that I might try messing with. The scanner mode was what made these so insecure back in the day, essentially everyone’s conversation was able to be listened into like a radio.The phone itself works, but the battery has a very short charge after all these years and I don’t have an antenna for it.References and LinksMobile Collectors - https://www.mobilecollectors.net/phone/5203/nec-p120FCC ID - https://fccid.io/A98MP5A1B1-1APatents:https://patents.google.com/patent/US4954951https://patents.google.com/patent/US4942516https://patents.google.com/patent/US4896260https://patents.google.com/patent/US4829419https://patents.google.com/patent/US4825364https://patents.google.com/patent/US4686622https://patents.google.com/patent/US4531182https://patents.google.com/patent/US4396976https://patents.google.com/patent/US4371923https://patents.google.com/patent/US4121284https://patents.google.com/patent/US4120583https://patents.google.com/patent/US4435732https://patents.google.com/patent/US4471385https://patents.google.com/patent/US4672457https://patents.google.com/patent/US4739396" }, { "title": "The Brain of A Hotel - Hac... or Inspecting the Tech Inside Hotels", "url": "/posts/hotel-tech-hacks/", "categories": "hacking", "tags": "embedded, smart-device-hacking, networking", "date": "2022-07-07 21:36:31 +0000", "snippet": "NOTE: The contents in this post are for educational purposes. Do not attempt any of the actions outlined here. You could get banned from hotels, fined, and make an IT guy’s job a lot harder.I recently stayed at a couple of hotels over the summer and as always I had to see what tech powered them.Both hotels were clean and I had a good stay except for the unexpected wakeup call.The first hotel (I’m keeping company names private for now) provided complimentary TV, but no free WiFi.A way to remedy this was to use an ethernet outlet in the room. One was being used for the Set Top Box and had what looked like an anti-theft connector.Upon closer inspection this was just to make sure no one got free internet. By simply sliding the room card under the lock and pressing back the prong on the RJ-45, it came free, and so did the internet. Full connection to the network.I did not find very much on the network at this hotel apart from the other Set Top Boxes sending dlna junk around. Unfortunately I refrained from further research on this hotel apart from noting the android-tv like interface on the television.Hotel number 2 had a lot more to offer. Having just been built around a year before, tech was cutting edge… or attempted to be.I like what I saw in this setup. From the TV you could view your current bill, view and change the room temperature, and of course watch TV.The TV seemed to be an LG NanoCell hospitality model that ran a modified WebOS specific for hotels.The only ports used was power (obviously), an ethernet port, and… a Chromecast?A neat added feature was casting to the TV. It turns out that they just slapped a Chromecast on the back and called it a day.They plugged it into the TV via a USB cable and the HDMI. It was also secured via an anti theft box which was just held on by phillips screws.You could select casting in the TV menu and it would switch to HDMI 2 - the port the Chromecast was connected to.Even being an official Google Chromecast I could not display anything but a black screen anytime I connected.I tried from multiple devices, but still got nothing. However, I will give them credit for trying. Casting is, I believe, a very needed feature in hotels, because who wants to login to their Netflix on a sketchy hotel TV anyway?But casting is hard, manily due to closed protocols, pricy software, and the many standards different devices use.The other features on the TV included free movies to stream. There was a single app which seemed to briefly show the WebOS web browser icon. I am not sure if it was the hotel’s local movie streaming site, or an online service, but the name was very vague and I didn’t have my packet capture equipment with me (an old network hub).There was no other streaming options. I wouldn’t have logged into any of my accounts anyway, but at least they could have added YouTube or a web browser!While many of the buttons on the remote were disabled, the input button worked, allowing you to connect a device to HDMI. Most other hotels disable that feature and I end up having to rip out the Set Top Box and connect my computer to that.The TV was mounted on a movable wall mount allowing for access behind. In the wall was a Cisco AP with a built in switch that connects to the TV.There were two ethernet ports for guests in the room. One above a desk and one by the tv. There was also an RJ-45 jack being used as an RJ-11 for the POTS phone? I guess RJ-11 jacks are getting harder to find.The jack above the desk worked the same as the guest WiFi, requiring a login to access the network. The port near the TV wasn’t even connected to anything!The NetworkI didn’t have much time in this hotel, nor did I bring my network hub so no packet sniffing from the TV.I did do a bit of network scanning and general broadcast address sniffing.I checked the DHCP server and sure enough it was running a webserver (lighttpd 1.4.55). The firewall is a Cisco Meraki MX100.From the status page there wasn’t much and fortunately the default password of these Cisco firewalls is the serial number.This means it was probably safe.Firewall InformationLanding Page of Cisco Security ApplianceThere were many subnets in which I did not have time to scan them all. I picked a few interesting ones.The WebOS TVs on the network had an exposed NodeJS webserver most likely for remote management and communication. I got a 404 when accessing them and I could not find anything else on it. If I had more time I could probably shut off everyone’s TVs or something.Portscan of a WebOS TVThis is probably one of the most interesting devices I found.When I looked through the scan results I found this:After going to the webpage I discovered that the device was a Technicolor DIRECTV COM3000. This is an IPTV headend system. Having worked with TVHeadend on my homelab I was a bit familiar with headends and IPTV, but this was much more advanced.The technicolor COM3000 (Also displayed as COM400)Image SourceThese devices use COM51 (as seen in the portscan) blade cards to connect to what looks like coax connections. There also seems to be 10 gigabit ethernet connections which are required to stream live video to every television.There were multiple results for these “COM51” webpages in the portscan which I’m assuming is a separate webserver for every card rather than multiple rackmount units.One of the web UIs did not have a password set.Information page for COM3000Channel ListYes, this meant I could mess around with every setting. Switch people from watching CNN to Fox News and vice versa. But as I said I was just here to spectate and find what technology was being used. Also most of the settings were beyond my knowledge of cable/satellite technology and were probably meant for DIRECTV technicians.This technology is nice to see however. (As long as it’s secure!) We are heading towards coax and tuning being obsolete if we aren’t already there. One of these units can be very efficient. For instance coax cables no longer need to be run. Everything streams via the network. You can give guests with premium access extra channels. Maybe families who request it will only get kid-friendly channels. With digital streaming many possibilities open up.Here is even a page on the COM3000 in hospitality environments.Maybe next we will see the analogue phone lines in hotels turn to IPBX systems?ConclusionThat was about all I found, I might revise this and add more information. If I had more time I would have searched deeper, but I still find it interesting to see the technology that hotels use as well as their insecurities.Unexpected Wakeup CallDuring the stay at the second hotel at about 10:30 PM I heard a sound and it took me a minute to realize that the fire alarms had been set off. So we left the room went down the stairs all the way around to the front. Asked the employees weather it was a false alarm. One said “maybe” and the other said “yeah” and silenced the alarm at the annunciator in the front. Fortunately there was no strobe in the room as it was only silenced.The fire department didn’t even arrive and they reset the alarm themselves. I’m not sure about the legal terms of that, but we had to hit the road early the next morning. I looked at the panel the next day and it said trouble in room 220. So thanks person in room 220.I’m not into the technical details of fire suppression systems, but it was interesting to see the fans in the stairwells made to exhaust smoke and/or heat as well as the other interesting systems in use.But other than that it was a clean, new hotel and we had a good stay." }, { "title": "New site! How it&#39;s going after moving to Jekyll and GitHub Pages", "url": "/posts/new-blog/", "categories": "blog", "tags": "site", "date": "2022-05-23 22:29:31 +0000", "snippet": "If you’re reading this you probably noticed the change. No longer am I using blogspot/blogger to post my updates, I am now using Github pages and a static site generator called Jekyll.It’s been a bit of a bumpy start to learn how the software works, but that’s what happens with software. Trial and error will bring you closer to success (usually).After messing around with Jekyll’s settings, various themes, and making a dozen commits to Github I think I have found I layout I like. I have tried TeXt, Minimal Mistakes, Atlas, and now finally Chirpy to use as a theme for my site. I like chirpy as it’s simple yet it still has a considerable amount of features when compared to other Jekyll themes. For instance recently updated, estimated reading time, and tags on the homepage.However, that is just a theme. Overall I moved away from Blogger because I wanted more flexibility. With Github pages you can simply upload raw html files without all the frontend. I know that Blogger has an HTML editor, but me being like other self-hosting open source people I wanted MORE CONTROL!!! And that’s why I ended up here.Personally I would say that a somewhat ideal blog platform would be Wordpress. Due to its popularity it has hundreds (heck maybe thousands) of plugins and countless tutorials. But there are a couple issues, the first being that it isn’t free. A true wordpress.org instance being hosted on a reliable server will cost money. Second is security. I can monitor the attacks on the services hosted on my home server and how they are 99% of the time aimed at wordpress. I don’t even host wordpress on my server, but I see countless http requests to things like /wp-admin/ and /wp-content/. Wordpress is like windows, wildly popular and wildly hacked.Because it doesn’t have a nice block editor like wordpress I have to write my pages in markdown, which is fine, but like other keyboard intensive softwares I will have to memorize a few things. Hashtags for headings, asterisk for italics, I’m getting there slowly but surely. Abricotine has been an awesome software for writing markdown. I suggest you check it out if you need to write markdown files often.Obviously I still have a few issues to work out such as embedding YouTube videos and easily inserting dates and categories to the tops of the posts, but eventually I’m sure I’ll find solutions.This was a very quick post that I typed up, but I hope you enjoyed reading it. I have been pretty busy lately, but I hope to get back into my normal YouTube routine and get some content released. I’m anxious to release videos of all the cool stuff I’ve been working on!" }, { "title": "UART (no root yet) on Nest Camera A0005 model", "url": "/posts/UART-(no-root-yet)-on-Nest-Camera-A0005-model/", "categories": "embedded, rooting", "tags": "nest, smart-device-hacking", "date": "2022-05-21 18:20:31 +0000", "snippet": " In my constant search of rootable devices I came across an indoor nest camera.

Here is the location and pinout:You may use any of the outside connectors for ground including the USB port. The UART runs at 115200 baud. After the device boots you get a login prompt. I tried a few passwords, but none worked. Unfortunately the bootloader doesn’t even output to the UART so you can’t change any boot options. It seems that the first line outputted is about linux and not the bootloader also it has a delay after plugging in which shouldn’t happen to the bootloader. The bootloader starts immediately. I tried different pins for another UART to no avail. If anyone could find the password or other UART to unlock the bootloader please let me know. Hopefully this post sheds a little light on this device’s inner workings.References and ResourcesFCC info: https://fccid.io/ZQANC11Teardown instructions: https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Nest_CamReversing the dropcam, great blog posts about rooting dropcams (before Nest) :https://blog.includesecurity.com/2014/03/reversing-the-dropcam-part-1-wireless-and-network-communications/https://blog.includesecurity.com/2014/04/reversing-the-dropcam-part-2-rooting-your-dropcam/https://blog.includesecurity.com/2014/08/reversing-the-dropcam-part-3-digging-into-complied-lua-functionality/Dropcam rooting for defcon: https://www.slideshare.net/cisoplatform7/defcon-22colbymoorepatrickwardlesynackdrop-camUART log: =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= PuTTY log 2022.05.20 18:28:20 =~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=[ 0.000000] Linux version 2.6.38.8 (jenkins@dropcam-build.local) (gcc version 4.5.2 (Sourcery G++ Lite 2011.03-41) ) #81 PREEMPT Tue Apr 2 18:49:38 UTC 2019[ 0.000000] CPU: ARMv6-compatible processor [4117b365] revision 5 (ARMv6TEJ), cr=00c5387f[ 0.000000] CPU: VIPT nonaliasing data cache, VIPT nonaliasing instruction cache[ 0.000000] Machine: Coconut[ 0.000000] Memory policy: ECC disabled, Data cache writeback[ 0.000000] Ambarella: AHB = 0x60000000[0xf0000000],0x01000000 0[ 0.000000] Ambarella: APB = 0x70000000[0xf1000000],0x01000000 0[ 0.000000] Ambarella: PPM = 0xc0000000[0xe0000000],0x00200000 9[ 0.000000] Ambarella: BSB = 0xc8c00000[0xe8c00000],0x00400000 9[ 0.000000] Ambarella: DSP = 0xc9000000[0xe9000000],0x07000000 9[ 0.000000] Ambarella: HAL = 0xc00a0000[0xfee00000],0x0000e708 9[ 0.000000] bootmem_init: high_memory = 0xc8a00000[ 0.000000] Built 1 zonelists in Zone order, mobility grouping on.

For instance you can have a web service torrent client like transmission running in a docker container and not have your ISP throttle your speed after detecting where the high traffic is coming from… Or perhaps download files from sites that aren’t available in your area. When I setup a simple docker container with Windscribe (a VPN with 10gb free and torrent access) and deluge, I ran into the problem of the web GUI of deluge not being accessible from the mapped docker port when the VPN was enabled.Why this happensMy VPN Windscribe has a LAN-bypass feature. Usually you cannot access devices in your local network or be accessed by your network when connected to the VPN. LAN-bypass allows everyone in your subnet to access the server. Docker uses its own virtual network for all of its containers. Therefore the containers treat your local network (outside of the docker containers, IE your server, router, and computer) like WAN. Take my local network for example: it uses the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet while my docker containers use 172.17.0.0/16 subnet. So Windscribe starts and looks at the ethernet controller as if you were type in ifconfig. Let’s say it sees 172.17.0.15. Windscribe now thinks that your local network is 172.17.0.0/16. The bypass only allows these IPs. Other containers can access this one as they are in the virtual docker network, but let’s say my laptop (10.0.0.89) tries to access the forwarded port, it will time out. Basically Windscribe (or any other VPN) thinks that the docker VLAN is LAN and your actual LAN is WAN and therefore blocks traffic.A good explanation is in this serverfault answer.Some possible solutions:The first solution you can try is enabling LAN access or even disabling the firewall. In windscribe CLI you can do this by typing in the docker container’s CLI: windscribe lan-bypass on windscribe firewall offThis did not work for me though. Issues may also occur with your VPN operating in the same subnet as your docker container, more information on this issue is in this docker issue. (the issue is for docker-mac, but could be applicable to other platforms)Connecting the docker container’s network to the host network is a possible solution, but can come with problems and will most definitely enable the VPN for your whole machine, which with a limited 10gb wouldn’t be ideal for everyone. What actually workedThis is a hack job solution, but here we go. Basically your network adapter on your host OS running docker will include a network adapter for the docker virtual network. The command ifconfig can bring up a list of network adapters. Usually the host OS’s IP address is the subnet plus 1. So for 172.16.0.0/16 it would be 172.16.0.1. We can actually ping all the docker containers from the host OS! So going back to the example of the docker container having the address 172.17.0.15, if we ping that we should get a response. The solution here would be to get some sort of a web proxy if you don’t already have one installed. I have apache web server installed, but nginx would work fine too (probably better). Add the proxy parameter to a virtualhost. This can be an issue especially if you are only working over LAN so you will need local DNS. In my case I finally ended up using jackett and transmission on the docker containers. I set my router running Fresh Tomato to define 10.0.0.30 (my server ip) to jackett.local and transmission.local. In apache config I put those two local addresses as my domain and pointed the proxy to 172.17.0.15:9117 and 172.17.0.15:9091. Why this might not be the best solutionDocker IP addresses are very dynamic. For me they sometimes change every time I reboot, add, or delete a container. So you will have to either keep changing your proxy config or set a static IP. I set a static IP.If it works it works.I will edit this later. I didn’t do too much research for this project yet, and will have to post issues in github, experiment, and read into this to solve the issue. I will hope to add detailed instructions soon, but for now, this is what I have." }, { "title": "Best Way to Automatically Switch to Dark Mode in Windows 10", "url": "/posts/Best-Way-to-Automatically-Switch-to-Dark-Mode-in-Windows-10/", "categories": "howto, review", "tags": "windows, dark-mode", "date": "2021-05-28 18:46:59 +0000", "snippet": " If you’re like me you don’t like bright whites on applications burning your eyes while using your PC in the later hours and you also like to have a bright screen during the day when the sun is shining. Windows does have a dark and light theme, but they do not switch automatically, meaning you will have to go into settings and do it yourself.To fix this issue I did some task scheduler magic to automatically change the theme. I got the instructions from this site. However it might not be the best solution and I had some issues of Windows setting the wrong theme when one or more schedules were missed. After some searching around I found a better solution.The better solution:A nice free and open source app on GitHub makes it possible to painlessly set how you would like the automatic light and dark mode settings to run.Download it hereClick Click here to download the newest version of Auto Dark Mode! and scroll down on the newest version to the assets tab where you can find the setup.exe. Once downloaded, run the setup and follow the installation instructions. The program will automatically open once the setup finishes and you will be greeted with some settings.If you close the program you can always open it again from the start menu.In the time settings of the program you can enable auto switching of light and dark mode and choose the time of when the switching happens. In the apps tab you can select what apps you want to adapt to the dark mode as well, most of the time you want it to adapt to system so that your web browser is also in dark mode.]Another neat feature is to make your desktop background change when in light or dark mode. For example in light mode you might want a background with vibrant colors and dark mode one that is more calm and includes a darker color scheme. In the settings tab you get some general settings and preferences such as language and clock format. Update settings are also available as well as user account options.The other couple tabs include information on the program and a place to donate to the developer who kindly made this program for anyone to use free of charge.Is it safe?This program is definitely safe. A lot of people think that nothing is really free and that a free piece of software is just harvesting your data for money, but that is not the case in this program. This program is different as it is open source. That means that anyone can see how the source code works and that the program is safe to use. It’s exposing the inside of the program so that anyone can use it, see how it works, and make their own version of it. So yes, since we can see how this program works we can verify that it is not a virus and your computer would be safe using it.Do you recommend it?Yes I highly recommend this software, as there would be no harm in trying it out. It’s easy to install and remove as well as the software is free. It had a lot of other features that I didn’t think about until getting the software and it is in general an awesome and useful program.After 1 month of using the software:I still use and will continue to use this software after a month of testing it. It’s worked great. It is tricky, however, to configure themes in windows with this software. I don’t really blame the software, but windows, because of many issues with their theme configuration. For instance you cannot edit a current theme, but instead have to delete the old theme and make a new one. For my light mode I don’t like the whole taskbar being white, which is why I use custom themes. I also change my desktop background from the nostalgic bliss wallpaper during the day to a fanmade night version of bliss as my wallpaper at night. It is excellent software once you get it configured, as I said Windows themes are a bit finicky at times, but the result made using my computer at night more enjoyable.More information hereI was not sponsored by anyone for recommending this program. It’s free and open source anyway so there is no point to. I just was glad I found it and needed a new blog post." }, { "title": "Upgrading my main rig", "url": "/posts/Upgrading-my-main-rig/", "categories": "pc, blog", "tags": "pc", "date": "2020-08-20 15:01:37 +0000", "snippet": "I recently uploaded a series of three videos about upgrading my main computer that I use for writing and editing my videos as well as a little gaming. The PC was originally the family computer that my dad purchased in 2010. It was an HP Pavilion Elite HPE-150f. HP has the original specs for their pc here:https://support.hp.com/lt-en/document/c01969874When it was originally manufactured it had these specs:Motherboard:MSI-7613(Iona-GL83)CPU:Intel i7 8602.8ghz quad coreMemory/RAM:8gb (4 x 2gb) ddr3GPU:Nvidia GT 230PSU:350wGigabit networkingFirst Upgrade (Circa 2013)When I was a young boy my father took me to microcenter to get a graphics card. The old GT 230’s fan controller broke and ran at an annoying high speed. He got me a GT 620. Because I was young at the time and not playing any demanding games on the computer so I didn’t need anything great. Second Upgrade (Circa 2014)I have always played older games for that nostalgia feel even though the games were made way before my time. I wanted to play a two disc game without the interruption of the game saying “Please insert disc 2” So I added a second drive to get rid of that problem. A simple SATA dvd drive would do. Third Upgrade (April 2020)This time I wanted the computer to boot and open programs faster, so I replaced the mechanical Seagate Barracuda with an Inland Professional 120gb SSD. But only after a month of usage as my boot drive the computer froze. I restarted it and got the bluescreen. I blamed windows until I pulled the SSD out and connected it to a SATA to USB adapter to my laptop. I could see the drive had corrupted it’s own firmware and got stuck in a read only mode. I was able to recover most of my data but a lot of it was still corrupted. So I got a real drive to replace it. I got a Samsung 860 evo 250gb. This drive is not only actually “professional” compared to the Inland garbage, but it is faster, twice the size, and has some great tools that allow me to reset the firmware. It has worked great for months without a problem.I used my old 1tb HDD as backup and extra storage.This was my first rig upgrade that was made into a video  and you can watch it here:Fourth Upgrade (June 2020)The most recent (as of August 2020) upgrade I made to my rig was quite a lot. I started with the case. I was browsing a resale shop when I found a new old stock computer case. It was weird yet cool. It’s called the Ultra Wizard and looks similar to an old Antec case. I decided to put my pc into this case.It has more drive bays than the prebuilt HP case I used to have as well as a lot more space. My old case opened on the opposite panel than most cases and all the parts inside were upside down. This case has a normal cover panel position. I also upgraded my old Nvidia GeForce GT 620 to a new GTX 1650. This made some video editing and gaming easier and more enjoyable.You can see all the videos here:ConclusionIt may not be the best rig and bottleneck calculator said that my rig has an 80% bottleneck. But it works. It can render 1080p video, it game do some gaming, and it’s fast to boot. Yes yes, someday I will upgrade to a Ryzen 5 or 7 (Unless Intel can win me back) as well as a new mobo and some ddr4 ram. And don’t forget the 350w prebuilt power supply that is like a ticking time bomb! But upgrading the main components like CPU, motherboard, and memory will be pretty expensive and my computer works fine for the time being.Overall if I calculate the cost of the upgrades I would say it’s around $250  bucks which isn’t too bad. This computer is a lot better than it was before even if it was an $1000 computer back in the day. (yeah, my dad pays too much for our computers, our current “family web browsing computer” has an unlocked i7)." }, { "title": "Samson Go Mic Review", "url": "/posts/Samson-Go-Mic-Review/", "categories": "review", "tags": "microphone, audio", "date": "2020-05-22 00:34:58 +0000", "snippet": "It’s not an easy job to pick out a microphone.

SSDs are very fast as they have no moving parts. Replacing you hard drive with an SSD for your boot drive can cut boot times in half! But what are SSDs? An SSD or solid state drive is a storage medium that works just like a flash drive or SD card. It uses semiconductor chips that are non-volatile which means that the data written on the chips will stay on the chips. RAM is similar to SSDs except that they are volatile which means most data will be wiped when power is disconnected. The storage in an SSD is managed by a controller. There are many different controllers such as the Phison controllers which tend to be in cheaper SSDs.When looking for a good SSD you probably won’t want to get a $20 one because they have a higher chance of failing and sometimes are slower than hard drives. If you want to see more information for cheap SSDs see this video by LTT.SSDs should have a DRAM cache like Linus says in the video. Otherwise they CAN be slower than hard drives.Also look out for cheap SSDs with the Phison S11 controller like said here in this reddit post:https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/90glkw/buyer_beware_sata_ssds_with_phison_s11_controllers/ Buyer Beware: SATA SSD’s with Phison S11 controllers Discussion The Phison S11 controller is relatively new, I’ve been deploying SSD’s with these controllers in custom routers since January 2018. They literally just run minimal CentOS + DHCP + DNS and a firewall, so basically no storage load is seen on them. So far this year, two have completely died. They are still detected by the bios, but when accessed they provide nothing but I/O errors. Data, partition tables, etc… all gone. A quick google search for this controller brings up a handful of other users experiencing the same issue across a multitude of different SSD vendors that have opted to use this controller for their latest SSD offerings. I have RMA’d all my remaining drives and have started preemptively replacing all of the ones i have in service. My supplier acknowledged they have had quite a few RMA’s on them for failing in &amp;lt; 6 months. If you have one of these i highly recommend you backup your data and get rid of it as soon as possible. You are only likely to see these in low performance SSD’s mind you, seems like they are popular in budget laptops as well.I myself had a bad experience with an SSD with a Phison S11 Controller. It was the Inland Professional 120gb. After 1 month of use the drive turned into a read only and I got the satafirm s11 problem. This is why I will NOT put it on this list.Here is my Reddit post on the situation of the Inland SSD:https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/g31yxi/beware_of_inland_ssds/ Beware of Inland SSDs! Discussion Inland SSDs include the Phison s11 controller (see more here: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/90glkw/buyer_beware_sata_ssds_with_phison_s11_controllers/) I purchased an Inland 120gb SSD and after one month of using it the drive died can no longer be modified. Can’t format. Can’t delete partitions. Can’t even write or delete data! This is a problem with these kinds of SSDs, but I found no posts talking about them, only ones about Kingston SSDs. I wanted to warn people before they go out and purchase these.And here is a video I published on YouTube about the problem with the Inland Professional SSD as well as a new Samsung 860 evo 250gb (which I highly recommend as a premium quality SSD):5. PNY CS900This SSD is a low cost one that is very reliable. It’s great if you are on a budget and want to speed up your current computer or build. Read and write speeds can come up to around 500 mb/s. Sometimes this drive will come with a copy of Acronis True Image HD 2017 data migration software. This software will easily allow you to migrate all your files and operating system from your old hard drive or SSD to your new PNY solid state.I would say that this is a very good drive as you can easily move your OS and files over to it. The speeds are enough to give you quick booting and faster copying. I would recommend this as a good budget SSD to freshen up your computer with faster booting times or add to a casual gaming build.4. SanDisk X400 SSDThis is a slightly higher quality SSD than the PNY CS900. Many of these drives made by SanDisk hold large amounts of data for an SSD. Some can hold around 500gb and some 1tb. If you want to get a large drive here is your option. Prices tend to be higher, however, you will get blazing fast speeds and boot times.I recommend this if you need a large SSD to replace a large hard drive. Or if you want to have a fast computer this would be a great choice. Just know that the price may be pretty high.3. Crucial MX seriesThis is a great choice for a high quality SSD for a reasonable price. These can be great for upgrades as they have great speeds and don’t cost as much as other high quality drives such as ones by Samsung.I would recommend this for new builds, but keep in mind that the write speeds on this drive are known to slow down over the years. (More substantially than other SSDs)2. Western Digital BlueThis drive is very similar to the Crucial SSD, but it can come in very high capacities like the SanDisk. The drive is not much more expensive as the Crucial and it has impressive speeds. The sizes range from 250gb all the way up to 4tb.I would recommend this for a fast storage drive in high capacities. For example you could use this as your steam library and run games and programs quickly off of it.1. Samsung 860 evoThis drive is more expensive, but very reliable. I have this drive installed in my computer to replace the Inland 120gb SSD that only lasted a month. This drive has amazingly fast speeds and is very reliable. My computer runs Windows 10 pro and boots in 8 seconds.I would recommend this drive as an OS drive. It works very well and the speeds are very fast. They are reliable and will last for a long time." }, { "title": "How to fix D-LINK DIR615 (E1) Firmware (solid orange light)", "url": "/posts/How-to-fix-D-LINK-DIR615-(E1)-Firmware-(solid-orange-light)/", "categories": "embedded, howto", "tags": "unbricking, router", "date": "2020-05-13 20:00:15 +0000", "snippet": "The D-Link DIR615 Firmware problem is common when the firmware is corrupted or the router was powered off during a firmware update.Steps to fix: Download the correct firmware for your router:(Safe Mega downloads)DIR615 type E1: http://bit.ly/DIRFIRMWAREE1DIR615 type E4: http://bit.ly/DIRFIRMWAREE4 Get PC ready for sendingYou must use an old pc/laptop for it to send. VM’s may work and I will test it in my free time. I used an old laptop circa 2003 that runs Windows XP. Set up IPGo to network settings in control panel. Go to adapter settings and right click your ethernet adapter. (Note: you cannot send the file via wifi) In the properties of your adapter select Internet Protocol Version 4 or Internet Protocol in Windows XP. Select “Use the following IP Address” and type in these IP’s:IP Address: 192.168.0.2Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (Should fill in automatically)Default Gateway: 192.168.0.1 Preferred DNS server: 192.168.0.1(leave alternate DNS blank) Press OK on all the dialog boxes. Connect the router to the computer via an ethernet cable. Make sure to connect the computer to one of the LAN ports on the router and not to the INTERNET port. Unplug the router if it is not already. Get a pencil, paperclip, or anything small enough to press the reset button. While the router is off hold down the small reset button next to the power input with the pencil. While still holding down the reset button, plug in the router. Continue holding the button until the orange power light starts flashing slowly and one of the LAN indicators turns green. You can stop pressing the button now. Assuming that you did all the steps right, didn’t skip a step, and kept your computer turned on and plugged into the router you can now open a web browser. I would recommend Internet Explorer or some generic browser instead of Chrome. The older the browser (and the older the computer) the better. Type 192.168.0.1 in the address bar. If anything pops up like “No internet connection” or “oH mY gOsH yOu’Re nOt cOnNeCtEd tO tHe iNtErNeT!!!!” just click “connect” or “continue”. If you did everything right then you should be looking at the DIR615 firmware recovery page. Click browse for file and select your firmware file. If you are using the correct OS, Browser, and computer then you should get a loading screen and the percentage increases. I do not believe the percentage is correct, but is just a timer making sure the user does not disconnect the computer before it is done sending the firmware. If it all worked out the router’s orange light should turn off for a little bit. Then it should turn back on as a working router! Resetting your computer. Open the adapter settings in control panel again and select the network adapter. Select your tcp/ip adapter and select automatically configure ip. Then click automatically configure DNS. Pres ok on all dialog boxes and close out. Disconnect the ethernet cable.You should be good to go! The router should work now and you can configure it in 192.168.0.1. Please note that there are other tutorials on this, but they are old. In this one I tell you that you must use an old computer to get this to work." } ]
