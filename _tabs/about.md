### About This Site

Whether you're here to learn about Computers or any other... stuff, welcome!

This is the site corresponding to my YouTube channel which you can find [here]	(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVtthC7KBBohRPLFFy6iNA)

On this site I upload various posts about different technology matters weather it be trying to root an old smart device to posting about my homelab. Some posts may have an accompanying video and some may be independent.


If you want to see the source code for the site check out the [github repo.](https://www.github.com/computersandstuff/computersandstuff.github.io)

### About Me
Hi, my name is Luke and I have always been interested in electronics. Over the years I have grown my interests and have explored various aspects of computers. I have found myself a specific liking in networking and I will likely pursue that field. Whenever I come across some sort of an embedded device I try to root it.
