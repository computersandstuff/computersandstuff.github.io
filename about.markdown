### About Computers And Stuff

Whether you're here to learn about Computers or any other... stuff, welcome!

This is the site corresponding to my YouTube channel which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuVtthC7KBBohRPLFFy6iNA)

Hopefully I will update this site soon. I just moved from blogger to this (Jekyll with github pages) which is new to me, but I'm getting the hang of it! If you want to see the source code for the site check out the [github repo.](https://www.github.com/computersandstuff/computersandstuff.github.io)

#### Here's the old badly formatted about page from my blogger site which I will replace soon with a shiny, new, informal page.

I have liked to work with computers, av equipment, cameras, and all sorts of technology since I was little. I have a YouTube channel where I post about different electronics and projects.

I plan to take this channel in the direction of networking and embedded systems.

YouTube Channels
Computers And Stuff  - This is my main channel where I post about technology
Computers And Stuff Media - This is a channel where I post long videos mostly content I have found on old random types of media such as VHS tapes.

Subscribing, Monetization, and Affiliates

I would appreciate my viewers Subscribing as it brings me one step closer to monetization. On YouTube I can start getting money for the advertisements played on my videos. I must have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours over the past year.

Here is my current subscriber count:

Though I don't like to bug people about subscribing and I no longer (though some of my earlier videos did) put Subscribe Garbage all over the video. It is ultimately your choice to subscribe or not. Subscribing is like a free donation to my channel, but if you don't want to Subscribe, I understand. You can also choose to click the notification bell or not to choose if you want to get notifications when I upload a new video.
