# Computers And Stuff site and blog
This contains the source code to my Jekyll site hosted on Github pages at [computersandstuff.github.io](https://computersandstuff.github.io)

You can create relevant issues and pull requests to add or correct information I have on my site.

Since it's a static site and there are no comments, feel free to put **meaningful** information into an issue. Please try to make it helpful such as more advanced information on a topic and not just "cool post". Thanks! (:
