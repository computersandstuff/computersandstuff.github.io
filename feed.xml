It has been a while. Two years since my last upload of an Apple Airport AP. To anyone who has been following, I’ve been pretty busy and I’m trying to find time for the channel.

The prints could be vie... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>NEC P120 Teardown - What makes up a 90s cell phone?</title><link href="/posts/NEC-P120-teardown/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NEC P120 Teardown - What makes up a 90s cell phone?" /><published>2022-08-17T21:36:31+00:00</published> <updated>2022-08-18T03:16:55+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/NEC-P120-teardown/</id> <content src="/posts/NEC-P120-teardown/" /> <author> <name>Luke</name> </author> <category term="teardown" /> <summary> Phones have come a long way from being bricks with minimal functionality to devices in which the “phone” function is not the most used. This NEC P120 is a look at the past and how you could make phone calls away from home.

Do not attempt any of the actions outlined here. You could get banned from hotels, fined, and make an IT guy’s job a lot harder. I recently stayed at a couple of hotels over the summer and as always I had to see what tech powered them. Both hotels were clean and I had a good stay except for the unexpected wakeup call.

No longer am I using blogspot/blogger to post my updates, I am now using Github pages and a static site generator called Jekyll. It’s been a bit of a bumpy start to learn how the software works, but that’s what happens with software. Trial and error will bring you closer to success (usually).
