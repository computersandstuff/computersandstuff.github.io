So you have a blocked site at work or school? 
It might not even be a *bad* site, maybe even a mistake! [Thanks to Palo Alto] (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27593565) one of my own was blocked for "adult content", none of which there was.
Now I have to block all their bots from my firewall.

But how do we browse our Insta on our work laptops or school chromebooks?

# Solution 1: Proxy sites

There are various proxy websites online, but most will be blocked by a firewall if any other sites are blocked.

[Lowband](http://www.loband.org/loband/simulator.jsp) (This is a dial up simulator, but it hasn't been blocked for me!)
