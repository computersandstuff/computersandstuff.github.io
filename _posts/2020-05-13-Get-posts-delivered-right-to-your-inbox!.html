This site has many updates coming in the future. I will also create many different tech posts. This website will strictly be about tech and my YouTube channel (which is about tech).<br /><br />I'll post tutorials, old technology reviews, new releases of technology which you will not want to miss if you like electronics. As I said, more will be posted in the future.<br /><br />If you would like the posts to be emailed right to your inbox you may subscribe to the news feed. It's free! And<b> <u>you may unsubscribe at any time</u></b>. The posts are sent using feedburner which is run by Google. (as of 5/13/2020 posts should be emailed at 11:00 am to 1:00 pm Central Time)<br /><br /><b>To subscribe</b> just click "subscribe" at the top and type the email address you would like it to be sent to. Next check your inbox for the confirmation email. This email is sent to <b><u>prevent spam</u></b> and prevent users from doing "prank subscriptions" on other people. After you click the confirmation link in the email you will be all set!<br /><br />You can now receive my posts via email and not miss a thing!
