Hello! 
It has been a while.

Two years since my last upload of an Apple Airport AP.

To anyone who has been following, I've been pretty busy and I'm trying to find time for the channel.
However, recently I ran into a roadblock.

About a couple months ago I released a Roblox game that allows you to print asset images on a real life receipt thermal printer at a low price. The prints could be viewed live on a YouTube livestream which I posted on my gaming/secondary channel. 
Keep in mind that this channel is under the same Google account as the Computers And Stuff channel. I would post these streams, often times daily and with great length. Most of the stream would just be looking at an inactive Epson printer.
One day I receive an email from YouTube notifing me that my channel has been deleted for multiple/severe violation(s) of the spam/scam category. I tried appealing multiple times explaining how I did not break TOS and was not misleading in any form, but those tries only got automatic responses.
YouTube's terrible form of contact never gets a real response and for the small guys, no one will ever come to save you. So what happens? Well my gaming channel is wiped from the internet and Computers And Stuff is abandoned. 
As the accounts are linked I cannot upload or modify anything on the Computers And Stuff channel. It remains up, however, as the livestreams were not posted on that channel.

So where do I go from here?

Screw YouTube, but I'm gonna start a new channel. I'll use this as an push to reorganize and recreate. I'll start a new channel (hopefully) with new content and go from there.

I wanted to write this to update my blog as my last post was from 2022 as well as get a bit of anger out at YT, but I hope I'll be back soon.
