It has been a while since my last post. Life happens, school and work are busy, but I am back. Today, I wanted to compile a list of different resources that can help an independent learner with networking skills. Going through schooling for a networking & cybersecurity degree has shown me how much independent work can be done. I wanted to help those who are not able to attend a university, who wish to save money, or similar. I'll be updating this with resources on the topic. I want to add my thoughts later, but also to create an initial post where I can note some resources.
